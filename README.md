# Gaussian-Mixture-Classification
A Gaussian Mixture Classifier I threw together in a hurry. 
DE_1 Code is the main file you want to look at. 

A very crudely thrown together Gaussian mixture classifier (the code's classifier is a mixture of 2 Guassians each of dimension 2, but this can be easily tweaked to arbitrary numbers and dimensions).
